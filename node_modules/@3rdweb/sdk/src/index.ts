/**
 * The {@link https://thirdweb.com | thirdweb} typescript sdk.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Please keep in mind that the thirdweb typescript sdk and {@link https://thirdweb.com/dashboard | Admin Dashboard} are currently in Early Access.
 *
 * Should you find bugs or in the case you need help please reach out to us in {@link https://discord.gg/thirdweb | Discord}. (We also have 🍪 )
 *
 *
 * @example
 * To get you started here's how you would instantiate the SDK and fetch some NFTs
 *
 * 1. Install the sdk
 * ```shell
 * npm install @3rdweb/sdk
 * ```
 *
 * 2. Get your NFT contract address from the {@link https://thirdweb.com/dashboard | Admin Dashboard}.
 *
 * 3. Write the tiniest amount of code!
 * ```typescript
 *  1 | import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@3rdweb/sdk";
 *  2 | import type { NFTModule, NFTMetadataOwner } from "@3rdweb/sdk";
 *  3 |
 *  5 | const contractAddress = "0x..."; // your contract address from step 2
 *  6 |
 *  7 | const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK();
 *  8 |
 *  9 | const nftModule: NFTModule = sdk.getNftModule(contractAddress);
 * 10 |
 * 11 | const nftListWithOwnerAddress: NFTMetadataOwner[] = await nftModule.getAllWithOwner();
 * 12 |
 * 13 | console.log(nftListWithOwnerAddress);
 * ```
 * ```
 * Output
 * => [
 *       {
 *          owner: "0x...",
 *          metadata: {
 *            name: "...",
 *            description: "...",
 *            image: "..."
 *          },
 *       },
 *       {
 *          owner: "0x...",
 *          metadata: {
 *            name: "...",
 *            description: "...",
 *            image: "..."
 *          },
 *       },
 *       ...
 *    ]
 * ```
